### What I learned:
Deep Neural Network is used interchangably with Multi Layer Perceptron (in tflearn)
Data wrangling techniques: tokenizing, POS labeling, chunking.
Labeling tokens based on POS labels
Categorizing training data
NLP techniques: stemming, lemmatizing


### What I don't understand:
Why do datasets require a dictionary having all ```True``` values?

## What's the most important thing?
Thoughts of correctness are more important than blindly writing code. Jupyter helps a lot.
